# Proxmox

In Proxmox, PAM and PVE (Proxmox VE) users differ as follows:

- PAM Users: These are authenticated through the Linux PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) system, typically used for system-level access. They can log in using system credentials.
- PVE Users: These are specific to Proxmox and managed within the Proxmox VE realm. They are used solely for Proxmox management and do not have system-level access unless explicitly granted.
